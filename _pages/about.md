Self Introduction
======

I'm now a fourth year undergraduate student from [University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB](https://en.ustb.edu.cn/), [School of Computer and Communication Engineering, SCCE](http://enscce.ustb.edu.cn/), majoring in Communication Engineering. 

I have been admitted to the [Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, IACAS](http://english.ioa.cas.cn/), Key Laboratory of Noise and Vibration Reaseach advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangxiaolin). I will soon start my master journey at YanQi Lake Campus, [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in September 2024.

My research interest includes Active Noise Control, Audio Signal Processing, and the Application of Signal Processing Algorithm in Deep Learning.

You can find my CV here: [Ma_Songqi's CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

Research Experience
======

I'm now doing my graduation project in the Institude of Acoustic, doing the replication of [paper](../assets/paper.pdf), analyse the noise charactor of submarine, wish to improve the tradition ANC algorithm to the submarine communication or sonar system.

I had an internship at the Distributed System Research Center of the [Institute of Computer Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, ICTCAS](http://english.ict.cas.cn/) from May 2023 to September 2023. I was involved in research and development of 6G service-oriented network function advised by [Prof. Lin Tian](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tianlin).

I had been an Research Assistant in the Labroatary of Wireless Optic Communication, USTB, research on the Optimal Design on LED-ID tag in the Visiable Light Imaging Positioning [1].

I had conduct an Beijing Scientific Research Training Program as team leader, research on the comparison between the Signal Processing Algorithm on Speech Enhancement [2].
